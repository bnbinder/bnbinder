### Hello there. My name is Benjamin, and I really like Dogs.... Oh yeah, and coding
- Iâ€™m currently working on my FRC robot and personal pet project website
- I've gotten to know these languages pretty well: Java, Python, C++, C# (Unity 2D and 3D), HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Fun fact: Ostriches can't fly, but no birds can match their speed on land. Ostriches are the fastest running birds in the world! Scientists have seen ostriches run continuously at speeds of 30-37 mph and sprint up to 43 mph. With their long, strong legs ostriches can cover more than 10 feet in a single stride. - Smithsonian National Zoo
